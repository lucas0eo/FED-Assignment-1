# KINGDOMS OF ELDORIA
This project is a game promotional website which promotes a fictional game called kingdom of eldoria. This website serves a form of information that users who are interested in the game can go to that website and find out more about it as well as download it.

## Design Process
The design process firstly included the draft of the wifreframe. However, I scrapped the entire draft after i realised i could make the website much better and so decided to start again from scratch to make the website have more interactions and be more aestically pleasing.
